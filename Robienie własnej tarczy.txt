Robienie własnej tarczy
1. Design - zaprojektować na papierze z uwzględnieniem tego co może platforma
When I’m designing watchfaces, I typically think of 4 things:
- Functionality
- Layout
- Font (keep in mind that font at smaller scales like this can impact final layout choices)
- Colors

I know that I want this watchface to show a few pieces of data:
- How much battery is left
- The user’s heartrate
- The current step count
- The current percent of step goal completion
- The count of phone notifications
- The date
- And of course, I want it to show the time
